If the app proves to be reliable again in the next few months, I'll raise my rating to 5 stars  1 star. I used this app for bitcoin and litecoin in the past and it used to work well. After the most recent update, my bitcoin wallet is frozen on \"initializing wallet\" so I can't access any of my funds. However, if I disable my bitcoin wallet, my litecoins are accessible. I'll update my review if this problem is fixed and my bitcoins restored, otherwise, don't download this."

If the app proves to be reliable again in the next few months, I'll raise my rating to 5 stars  1 star. I used this app for bitcoin and litecoin in the past and it used to work well. After the most recent update, my bitcoin wallet is frozen on \"initializing wallet\" so I can't access any of my funds. However, if I disable my bitcoin wallet, my litecoins are accessible. I'll update my review if this problem is fixed and my bitcoins restored, otherwise, don't download this."

I get the confirmation, press confirm, and then nothing happens. The zcash doesnt move.   Just pressing the menu button is a gamble. Who knows if it'll load correctly? I like what they're trying to do with the super custom UI, but the UX really needs to be tightened up. This is peoples money you're playing with, it's not a social app. I'm on Pixel XL."

If the app proves to be reliable again in the next few months, I'll raise my rating to 5 stars  1 star. I used this app for bitcoin and litecoin in the past and it used to work well. After the most recent update, my bitcoin wallet is frozen on \"initializing wallet\" so I can't access any of my funds. However, if I disable my bitcoin wallet, my litecoins are accessible. I'll update my review if this problem is fixed and my bitcoins restored, otherwise, don't download this."

I updated app, reinstalled, restored my wallet yet its not possible to send my BTC to anyone nor can I exchange it. Simply put, don't use them! For a week now yet same, not working and developer is retard as he ignores me. App takes 10sec to load, while he said its fastest and lightest wallet. Also its inefficient to use it, I suggest to use another multi wallet like Coinomi. Avoid FreeWallet too, read reviews, and thank me later.  Avoid Jaxx too, simply put, scam. Still not working as of now, will update review when it starts working. Developer still ignores my mails and doesn't reply.  Update: 07 Sep it works, and cheapest transaction fee is 1.3$ while Blockchain Wallet charges at same time 0.1$, this is ridiculous, SegWit enabled too now, why not cheap? Fk this sht im out, i will not move away from Blockchain ever again."

Apparently, of you make a lot of transactions Jaxx will flag your wallet as a miners wallet and not let you send out some of your currencies. Shapeshift integration is also buggy, I've had several currency conversions that got stuck, my funds were sent but I didn't receive any of the destination currency. Quite disappointed with the entire experience, Jaxx has a long way to go as its too buggy at the moment to be relied on for your hard earned money. For these reasons I DO NOT recommend Jaxx wallet!!!!"

I get the confirmation, press confirm, and then nothing happens. The zcash doesnt move.   Just pressing the menu button is a gamble. Who knows if it'll load correctly? I like what they're trying to do with the super custom UI, but the UX really needs to be tightened up. This is peoples money you're playing with, it's not a social app. I'm on Pixel XL."

If the app proves to be reliable again in the next few months, I'll raise my rating to 5 stars  1 star. I used this app for bitcoin and litecoin in the past and it used to work well. After the most recent update, my bitcoin wallet is frozen on \"initializing wallet\" so I can't access any of my funds. However, if I disable my bitcoin wallet, my litecoins are accessible. I'll update my review if this problem is fixed and my bitcoins restored, otherwise, don't download this."

I updated app, reinstalled, restored my wallet yet its not possible to send my BTC to anyone nor can I exchange it. Simply put, don't use them! For a week now yet same, not working and developer is retard as he ignores me. App takes 10sec to load, while he said its fastest and lightest wallet. Also its inefficient to use it, I suggest to use another multi wallet like Coinomi. Avoid FreeWallet too, read reviews, and thank me later.  Avoid Jaxx too, simply put, scam. Still not working as of now, will update review when it starts working. Developer still ignores my mails and doesn't reply.  Update: 07 Sep it works, and cheapest transaction fee is 1.3$ while Blockchain Wallet charges at same time 0.1$, this is ridiculous, SegWit enabled too now, why not cheap? Fk this sht im out, i will not move away from Blockchain ever again."

Apparently, of you make a lot of transactions Jaxx will flag your wallet as a miners wallet and not let you send out some of your currencies. Shapeshift integration is also buggy, I've had several currency conversions that got stuck, my funds were sent but I didn't receive any of the destination currency. Quite disappointed with the entire experience, Jaxx has a long way to go as its too buggy at the moment to be relied on for your hard earned money. For these reasons I DO NOT recommend Jaxx wallet!!!!"

Also the shapeshift or transfer by fiat amount often produces the wrong amount in crypto. Watch this closely. I accidentally sent 10 pounds worth instead of 500 pounds because of that error. Other than this I have no issue. Very good wallet. Allows me to trade within reason wherever I am."

Jaxx supports coins that other mobile wallets do not and up until the recent debate on security has had a clean track record."

Regarding the later, shall we call it a complaint, I suppose I could just reinstall a new wallet and deal with the \"seed,\" a bit of a nuisance if you ask me. I'm hopeful my two complaints will be addressed in future up-dates."

Finally, a lot of the reviews are blaming Jaxx for issues that are entirely the cryptocurrencies fault! i.e. Bitcoins high fees and slow confirmation times due to full blocks, not Jaxx."

Hi got a ton of mining ability setup and built up a good amount of each currency I can mine through that program. I never got a wallet because it is allowing you to use their services of wallet until you need a certain type of wallet for certain type of transactions. For the past few months I have been trying to contact them and another Institution and saving every bit of documentation to prove my point and this is what is going to destroy such a great thing to get us away from the central Bankers are these little chump companies taking our hard-earned mind currencies. I'm warning you do not try this or minor gate for sure"

It seems like just selecting change bitcoin to ETC would automatically fill in your two wallets since you have both in the same app, but no.  That field that says shapeshift means they will convert your coins then give them to shapeshift! That is the destination wallet.  Very deceptive and I'm sure intentional."

They probably have lawsuits on their hands all over the place. One of my wallets is frozen and can only receive funds. I have cleared cash and done everything they've asked me to and they will not respond to my second email that answers their questions. I've sent in multiple tickets and filled out their form exactly how they wanted it. I also have this problem on multiple platforms with the newest version of the app. Again do not use this app you will lose money. I bet they will not even be around within a year."

Jaxx keeps no record of the transaction history so I can't prove what ether address was specified and the one shapeshift sent it to isn't in my ether wallet. Don't use the on board shift function. You could lose your money. If you must use this wallet use the seperat shapeshift app and just copy the addresses over manually."

The design/style is pleasant to look at.  It's one downfall is the lag. It works but it's extremely slow to register any functions.   Is there a plan to fix this?  Once it's fixed I will change my review accordingly."

I would like the option of more security (at a minimum, a longer PIN) before storing more than a few $ worth. Alternatively, allow for splitting of amounts between mobile app and desktop wallets (so it's all synced but the larger amounts are not as susceptible from a particular device), or perhaps ability to set a daily limit of mobile transactions or to disable the mobile app access on a device if lost/stolen. Basically, I like the idea of an easy to use, cross platform, multi-currency wallet. But a 4-digit PIN on mobile banking is good when there is theft protection/insurance guaranteed by a bank...not for digital currency with no such safeguards."

I just noticed that I sent on January 4 eth from my jaxx to my coinbase account, but just found out I didn't receive them (had issues with my coinbase, Just succeeded to log in) even though it shows in my jaxx that the transaction was confirmed.   Would you mind having a look at my issue plz . Thanks #longlifejaxx."

Also there has previously been many many bugs with all versions of Jaxx on Android, Desktop, as extensions and so on. I have not noticed any bugs with the new Android version yet. If you can fix the splash screen and preferably remove it I will give 4 stars. I just read what other people have said and I agree that the interface has been a bit slow and heavy and I hope you are working to make this app as fast as possible. Remove the splash screen, overall make it faster and more responsive and please make the design slightly less dystopic and more user friendly."

I wish you didn't bury Bitcoin fees in the settings in 1.2. Fee handling deserves a lot more attention now that the fee market is becoming a usability problem. I also want custom fee amounts and fees displayed in USD or EUR and Jaxx can't do that either. If I want to do something advanced like custom fees or child-pays-for-parent I actually have to export my keys to Electrum. There's nothing here in Jaxx for power users like me.  Further disappointed by how the Jaxx team backed out of Monero integration. This could have been a decent Monero wallet even if you had just left RingCT and mixin at a default value and never showed it to the user.  Shapeshift is working just fine but I'd really like a link to the Shapeshift transaction on their website."

It's absolutely fine as long as you're just sending stuff to it but good luck trying to pay for food in a restaurant or get your BTC, REP, ETH or ZEC onto an exchange to sell it. So many freezes, empty error messages, transfers that look like they've sent but don't, missing transfer entries, etc.. I've used this app for months and the two times I've needed it to work have been a disaster, even using the Chrome extension version gives the same problems. Stay the hell away, this project is in trouble. (I'm not receiving mining rewards)"

It's mandatory to have ETH to sell REP?  How many ETH I must have in the wallet to sell REP?  I have to buy ETH to sell REP?  It seems to me incredible, but I need a solution to resolve the problem. All the features about BTC and ETH works very well and my comment is positive.  About REP everything is negative because, if the situation is this, I have to keep REP in the wallet for all my life. Change or explain situation about REP, Just now I have tried to shift from REP to ETH or BTC but is not possible. I receive always the same message . At this moment my review is completely NEGATIVE.  If support answers I can change opinion. Thank you"

Would be nice if font colours could be changed and the application loaded a bit quicker, Mycelium seems to load faster at the moment on my note 4. Currently I think Jaxx looks very promising."

I had my jaxx bitcoin address to receive payments from several places, when the address changes I had to go back to each of the to update. I had no other choice than to switch to a wallet that doesn't change addresses unless I create a new wallet within it."

Jaxx plans to integrate many other cryptocoins soon. Shapeshift exchange is integrated. Jaxx is secure. Its design is \"client-side\" meaning your keys never leave your phone. Jaxx provides you with a secret 12 word key that you can use to restore your wallet on any devices you might have in the future. And you can run the same wallet on both your phone and pc if you want to."

If you want to scan QR codes use the pic that looks like a camera...not the pic that looks like a tiny QR code. If you find your send button is not working it's because you're trying to send too much. Your not leaving enough in the account to allow for the for the fee. =)"

All private keys are encrypted and stored locally without ever being sent over the internet. That is a MUST!

However, I'm newbie in cryptocurrencies so I had some problems transferring funds from exchanger to Jaxx extension. I contacted their support and I was pleasantly surprised by the detailed guidance for my issue and kind approach from Simon (support staff). I downloaded Android version too and I can say only the best about this app/extension."
