        "comment": "  UPDATE: After reinstalling a few times (make sure you have your backup codes), my bitcoins are back so it seems to be working now, my bitcoin wallet just loads slowly. If the app proves to be reliable again in the next few months, I'll raise my rating to 5 stars  1 star. I used this app for bitcoin and litecoin in the past and it used to work well. After the most recent update, my bitcoin wallet is frozen on \"initializing wallet\" so I can't access any of my funds. However, if I disable my bitcoin wallet, my litecoins are accessible. I'll update my review if this problem is fixed and my bitcoins restored, otherwise, don't download this."

App team locked me out of bitcoin during the recent hard fork.  Devs should not be able to restrict use of app, will not use in future!  Still searching for a worthy, multicoin wallet for android that supports relevant coins and cannot be disabled by devs."

I updated app, reinstalled, restored my wallet yet its not possible to send my BTC to anyone nor can I exchange it. Simply put, don't use them! For a week now yet same, not working and developer is retard as he ignores me. App takes 10sec to load, while he said its fastest and lightest wallet. Also its inefficient to use it, I suggest to use another multi wallet like Coinomi. Avoid FreeWallet too, read reviews, and thank me later.  Avoid Jaxx too, simply put, scam. Still not working as of now, will update review when it starts working. Developer still ignores my mails and doesn't reply.  Update: 07 Sep it works, and cheapest transaction fee is 1.3$ while Blockchain Wallet charges at same time 0.1$, this is ridiculous, SegWit enabled too now, why not cheap? Fk this sht im out, i will not move away from Blockchain ever again."

Apparently, of you make a lot of transactions Jaxx will flag your wallet as a miners wallet and not let you send out some of your currencies. Shapeshift integration is also buggy, I've had several currency conversions that got stuck, my funds were sent but I didn't receive any of the destination currency. Quite disappointed with the entire experience, Jaxx has a long way to go as its too buggy at the moment to be relied on for your hard earned money. For these reasons I DO NOT recommend Jaxx wallet!!!!"

Checkout coinomi, no pairing with other devices like this wallet.  Really lije jaxx, too - I use many, many wallets and hoping jaxx grows into the multicoin, pairable, and impenetrable wallet it wants to be."

Also the shapeshift or transfer by fiat amount often produces the wrong amount in crypto. Watch this closely. I accidentally sent 10 pounds worth instead of 500 pounds because of that error. Other than this I have no issue. Very good wallet. Allows me to trade within reason wherever I am."

Also, the option to view my Bitcoin in the ZAR currency option (South African Rands) always shows up as R0.00, so I always have to view it in US Dollars instead."

Jaxx supports coins that other mobile wallets do not and up until the recent debate on security has had a clean track record."

For the past few months I have been trying to contact them and another Institution and saving every bit of documentation to prove my point and this is what is going to destroy such a great thing to get us away from the central Bankers are these little chump companies taking our hard-earned mind currencies.

        "comment": "  This app is designed to be a scam.  When you want to shapeshift be careful! It says shapeshift at the top that is actually a field that you should put the destination wallet.  It seems like just selecting change bitcoin to ETC would automatically fill in your two wallets since you have both in the same app, but no.  That field that says shapeshift means they will convert your coins then give them to shapeshift! That is the destination wallet.  Very deceptive and I'm sure intentional."

They ask you question after question and make you jump through multiple hoops and don't ever respond to your second email. Their system is screwed up and they know it. They probably have lawsuits on their hands all over the place. One of my wallets is frozen and can only receive funds. I have cleared cash and done everything they've asked me to and they will not respond to my second email that answers their questions. I've sent in multiple tickets and filled out their form exactly how they wanted it. I also have this problem on multiple platforms with the newest version of the app. Again do not use this app you will lose money. I bet they will not even be around within a year."

Jaxx keeps no record of the transaction history so I can't prove what ether address was specified and the one shapeshift sent it to isn't in my ether wallet. Don't use the on board shift function. You could lose your money. If you must use this wallet use the seperat shapeshift app and just copy the addresses over manually."

It offers the facility to store a range of desirable coins all with their own individual public + private keys and 12 word recovery phrases .  In addition you also the get a key for the entire wallet portfolio. Unfortunately my waves transaction got stuck in the form data and I just cannot get it out no matter how many times I try to clear the cache."
