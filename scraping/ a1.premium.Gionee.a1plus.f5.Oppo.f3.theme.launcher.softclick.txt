I get the confirmation, press confirm, and then nothing happens. The zcash doesnt move.   Just pressing the menu button is a gamble. Who knows if it'll load correctly? I like what they're trying to do with the super custom UI, but the UX really needs to be tightened up. This is peoples money you're playing with, it's not a social app. I'm on Pixel XL."

        "comment": "  UPDATE: After reinstalling a few times (make sure you have your backup codes), my bitcoins are back so it seems to be working now, my bitcoin wallet just loads slowly. If the app proves to be reliable again in the next few months, I'll raise my rating to 5 stars  1 star. I used this app for bitcoin and litecoin in the past and it used to work well. After the most recent update, my bitcoin wallet is frozen on \"initializing wallet\" so I can't access any of my funds. However, if I disable my bitcoin wallet, my litecoins are accessible. I'll update my review if this problem is fixed and my bitcoins restored, otherwise, don't download this."
