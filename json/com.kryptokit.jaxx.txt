I have a video of my phone screen explaining what I'm doing. Help!! I need a developer!!"

I updated app, reinstalled, restored my wallet yet its not possible to send my BTC to anyone nor can I exchange it. Simply put, don't use them! For a week now yet same, not working and developer is retard as he ignores me. App takes 10sec to load, while he said its fastest and lightest wallet. Also its inefficient to use it, I suggest to use another multi wallet like Coinomi. Avoid FreeWallet too, read reviews, and thank me later.  Avoid Jaxx too, simply put, scam. Still not working as of now, will update review when it starts working. Developer still ignores my mails and doesn't reply.  Update: 07 Sep it works, and cheapest transaction fee is 1.3$ while Blockchain Wallet charges at same time 0.1$, this is ridiculous, SegWit enabled too now, why not cheap? Fk this sht im out, i will not move away from Blockchain ever again."

Apparently, of you make a lot of transactions Jaxx will flag your wallet as a miners wallet and not let you send out some of your currencies. Shapeshift integration is also buggy, I've had several currency conversions that got stuck, my funds were sent but I didn't receive any of the destination currency. Quite disappointed with the entire experience, Jaxx has a long way to go as its too buggy at the moment to be relied on for your hard earned money. For these reasons I DO NOT recommend Jaxx wallet!!!!"

I transfered my Bitcoin from another wallet to Jaxx, and for 3 weeks it said the transaction was unconfirmed.

Also, the option to view my Bitcoin in the ZAR currency option (South African Rands) always shows up as R0.00, so I always have to view it in US Dollars instead."

Jaxx supports coins that other mobile wallets do not and up until the recent debate on security has had a clean track record."

The Windows app doesn't display wallet values, but... one bug at a time, and the fact that you can *link* your desktop and mobile accounts is pretty cool."

Thrice my balance was reduced within two days of observing. I told myself to get out. This was the major problem I had. Another is that the transaction history has bugs. Hence, i was having a difficult time in keeping track of my balance and transactions."

For the past few months I have been trying to contact them and another Institution and saving every bit of documentation to prove my point and this is what is going to destroy such a great thing to get us away from the central Bankers are these little chump companies taking our hard-earned mind currencies.

They ask you question after question and make you jump through multiple hoops and don't ever respond to your second email. Their system is screwed up and they know it. They probably have lawsuits on their hands all over the place. One of my wallets is frozen and can only receive funds. I have cleared cash and done everything they've asked me to and they will not respond to my second email that answers their questions. I've sent in multiple tickets and filled out their form exactly how they wanted it. I also have this problem on multiple platforms with the newest version of the app. Again do not use this app you will lose money. I bet they will not even be around within a year."

Jaxx keeps no record of the transaction history so I can't prove what ether address was specified and the one shapeshift sent it to isn't in my ether wallet. Don't use the on board shift function. You could lose your money. If you must use this wallet use the seperat shapeshift app and just copy the addresses over manually."

It offers the facility to store a range of desirable coins all with their own individual public + private keys and 12 word recovery phrases .  In addition you also the get a key for the entire wallet portfolio. Unfortunately my waves transaction got stuck in the form data and I just cannot get it out no matter how many times I try to clear the cache."

I would like the option of more security (at a minimum, a longer PIN) before storing more than a few $ worth. Alternatively, allow for splitting of amounts between mobile app and desktop wallets (so it's all synced but the larger amounts are not as susceptible from a particular device), or perhaps ability to set a daily limit of mobile transactions or to disable the mobile app access on a device if lost/stolen. Basically, I like the idea of an easy to use, cross platform, multi-currency wallet. But a 4-digit PIN on mobile banking is good when there is theft protection/insurance guaranteed by a bank...not for digital currency with no such safeguards."

        "comment": "  What bothers me most with Jaxx is the splash screen taking 20-30 seconds to load. Also there has previously been many many bugs with all versions of Jaxx on Android, Desktop, as extensions and so on. I have not noticed any bugs with the new Android version yet. If you can fix the splash screen and preferably remove it I will give 4 stars. I just read what other people have said and I agree that the interface has been a bit slow and heavy and I hope you are working to make this app as fast as possible. Remove the splash screen, overall make it faster and more responsive and please make the design slightly less dystopic and more user friendly."

        "comment": "  Edit: Decentral's comment is correct. DASH nodes were down interrupting service but they're back up. I've added one star.  I wish you didn't bury Bitcoin fees in the settings in 1.2. Fee handling deserves a lot more attention now that the fee market is becoming a usability problem. I also want custom fee amounts and fees displayed in USD or EUR and Jaxx can't do that either. If I want to do something advanced like custom fees or child-pays-for-parent I actually have to export my keys to Electrum. There's nothing here in Jaxx for power users like me.  Further disappointed by how the Jaxx team backed out of Monero integration. This could have been a decent Monero wallet even if you had just left RingCT and mixin at a default value and never showed it to the user.  Shapeshift is working just fine but I'd really like a link to the Shapeshift transaction on their website."

It's absolutely fine as long as you're just sending stuff to it but good luck trying to pay for food in a restaurant or get your BTC, REP, ETH or ZEC onto an exchange to sell it. So many freezes, empty error messages, transfers that look like they've sent but don't, missing transfer entries, etc.. I've used this app for months and the two times I've needed it to work have been a disaster, even using the Chrome extension version gives the same problems. Stay the hell away, this project is in trouble. (I'm not receiving mining rewards)"

I receive this message : \"Some of your REP holding accounts requires more ETH to be able to transfer\"  I have sent a question to support center some days ago but I have no answers.  It's mandatory to have ETH to sell REP?  How many ETH I must have in the wallet to sell REP?  I have to buy ETH to sell REP?  It seems to me incredible, but I need a solution to resolve the problem. All the features about BTC and ETH works very well and my comment is positive.  About REP everything is negative because, if the situation is this, I have to keep REP in the wallet for all my life. Change or explain situation about REP, Just now I have tried to shift from REP to ETH or BTC but is not possible. I receive always the same message . At this moment my review is completely NEGATIVE.  If support answers I can change opinion. Thank you"

I am still waiting on either the return of btc to my wallet I used to change to Dao, or for the Dao to show up from 4 hours ago! also am waiting for btc&gt;eth too! No more features, just fix t"

However, starting the application takes way too long and the UI needs to be rethought. The interface feels very top heavy and conforms to neither Material Design nor iOS design specs. Selecting different wallets requires tapping tiny icons when a simple swipe would suffice. If this app were faster and easier to use, it would definitely be my go to mobile wallet."

Testing a possible replacement, I sent .01 eth to coinomi ether wallet beta, but was unable to send ether from the coinomi wallet (send not implemented?). Ok, now, an hour later?

I was confused about a couple of little things but received great customer support. Here's a few tips... If you want to scan QR codes use the pic that looks like a camera...not the pic that looks like a tiny QR code. If you find your send button is not working it's because you're trying to send too much. Your not leaving enough in the account to allow for the for the fee. =)"

Cant even read BitPay QR codes?! love the QR code scan method to sync with the Chrome extension! All the benefits of an online cloud wallet, but none of the security risks! All private keys are encrypted and stored locally without ever being sent over the internet. That is a MUST! If I can find something wrong with this app, I will remove a star :)  I also love kryptokit made by these guys. If only this app did simple PGP encryption like KK... But, that's totally an unrelated feature"

I cannot send funds, I cannot use Shapeshift, and Im staring to consider alternatives. LG G3 android 6.0"

No real complaints, but a problem I'm having with the last update is when I get out of the app and open it back up it gives an error, but opens once I click the icon again.. I'm on a galaxy s5 with lollipop.. I know this will get fixed so no worries. Great job already guys!  Keep it up."

Need open source or a third party audit but I hear that's in the works. Would happily pay for this or donate. Few small features missing but I know they're on the way. Just wait until a contract builder is built in ;). Please, let us hide the BTC wallet if we choose and add a changelog toast. You guys rock!"
