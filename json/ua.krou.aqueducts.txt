Multiple start point and end points could also be a way to make things more interesting."

        "comment": "  This is a fun little indie game no doubt. The controls while yes can be touchy it just forces you to be more careful and to think. It's not a great concept too the graphics work very well for it but what it does need is to randomly generate maps. As a note to the developers having some sort of paid mode after you beat all the levels were players can say for a nominal fee of 0.99$ or even 1.99$ choose a difficulty level and either a time or move scored round and have the game generate a map for the player would make this game be a virtually endless little, relaxing time, eating pocket companion. But until that happens unfortunately this games beautiful style and enticing gameplay is limited to how long it takes for people to get bored of the same levels and delete the app."

A few comments and questions 1) if the background music could be diversified - maybe just for the end level of each stage you could put in a more triumphant melody or variation to go with the finishing of the city. That would be inspiring and awesome.  2) in terms of sound effects, when moving the aqueducts maybe the finishing move can have a click or thump sound or something. The sound is so beautiful in this game and perhaps you can give more satisfaction with a single different sound. Again just an idea, maybe the simplicity is the best. 3) not sure why some of the stars are clear and some are solid upon finishing an aqueduct?  Anyways what a splendid and graceful game. I really hope a sequel is in the works and looking forward to trying your other work!"

Love how the flow of water can irrigate fields and make whole civilisations rise up if you complete the task. You'll need to pay for the rest of the levels after the two free stages but so far, they are definitely worth it."

I probably will when I'm able to ^^"

        "comment": "  There are some good ideas here, and it almost is a delightfully calm Zen puzzle game that I could really enjoy. Unfortunately that asthetic is badly damaged by a couple simple things: 1. The nice calm music and sounds are interrupted by harsh bings and cringy celebration text after finishing every level, and 2. As soon as you finish a level, you have just a couple seconds to enjoy the success and serine sounds of continuous water flow, before clouds load you into the score screen, then dump you back to the map, then back to the next level, with a tap needed every time. If you could simply never show the score screen, lingering on the completed puzzle indefinitely, and move directly to the next puzzle with a tap and no break in audio, this would be a 5 star relaxing game."

Dion't need a game to remind me! OH! The absolute BEST thing is that when there is something you need to pay for... like getting the ads out...they give you a list of choices from $0 to $4.99!! Other developers need to take a lesson on how to do that -- NOT $99.99 that's just ridiculous! Maybe some people have money to spend on a game, BUT not everyone has that kind of money! Thank you for a great game!!"

Instead of focusing on a relaxed challenge it instead attempts to both relaxing and stressful at the same time adding a very jarring element to an other wise slow and methodical game.   Additionally the ad placements are also quite jarring and detract immensely from your focus. I think they could have been implemented more smoothly and still served the same purpose.  I upgraded to the paid version of the game (which removes ads) because I see a lot of potential and I like the concept of \"pay what you want\" as I currently don't have a lot of disposable income to dump into a grind fest. If the game added a \"relaxed mode\" where you didn't have the potential to lose as well as the ability to 'undo' or counter rotate blocks I would up my score to a 5."

        "comment": "  This is a very solid puzzle game. It's a take on the pipe puzzle that doesn't do anything revolutionary but instead tries to perfect the simple game play and wraps it in beautiful but minimalistic isometric graphics. The game has great level design and well-balanced challenge that keeps you engaged and offers even more for those who want to get 3 stars for each stage. The controls could be improved, since even on a pretty big phone screen I sometimes click on the wrong part, but that's not a big problem. I also loved the fact that they have a pay-what-you-want model for unlocking rest of the stages. At first I thought you have to pay at least something, but there's an option for 0 dollars, meaning you can play them for free (just with ads). Just for that, I'm probably going to choose pay at least a dollar or so to remove the ads (even though I rarely pay anything for mobile ganmes), because I want to encourage developers to use such a system more often."

However, I do have one issue with this game. The levels become monotonous and seem to plateu in difficulty after chapter 4 or so. No new mechanics are added, and some even appearing only ONCE to never show up again. The mechanics are never mismatched (for instance, tiles with 3 pathways only show up on \"timed\" puzzles, and there are no ivy covered tiles save for 1 or 2 levels). I believe that the addition of new mechanics as well as levels involving multiple mechanics would make the further chapters of this game much MUCH more interesting."

The game is a little easy for me.  It is like \"pipe dream\" and other games.  You have x number of moves to complete the puzzle.  I liked the second level where they timed it and had 2 paths to create.  I don't know how much more complex it gets as I found the controls a bit annoying.  In order to rotate a pipe you have to tap.  You can't rotate left (unless I missed the control) so you have to tap 3 times and it is a little slow.  Graphics are very nice though and I would recommend it for anyone that enjoys easy puzzle games."

There are only two types of levels - moves-based, where touching the screen once in the wrong place can mean missing out on three stars (an undo-last-move button would be helpful); and time-based, where it's against the clock. Both levels have their own element of frustration, and a bit of variety would help improve the game."

And there you have it, you lose so much time already. Plus, you get more and more pieces that also eats up more time! Instead of being relaxed, you get stressed/frustrated because you didn't finish the level on time hahahahahahaha...i wish everything were more faster...but other than that, it was actually relaxed especially the sound of the water and the BG music :)"

If you finish a level with 2 stars and get only 1 in your next attempt, game overrides previous score. Also, choosing to retry after finishing a level doesn't save score. Would be nice to know what the target amount of remaining moves for each star is. I'd still recommend it, though, for its simplicity and premise."

The stages we're challenging, half way through, the rest were real easy, I think due to the fact that you can easily see a pattern in each stage, would just like to see my previous solutions and a change in environment when you continue to a next level, as the levels all looked like ancient Greece mixed with American landscapes, maybe try a Chinese winter, or a tropical forest, but still keeping the mood the same. Thanks for an enjoyable days play."

Having finished the free levels,  I have a couple of quick questions: 1) if I choose to pay cash for the other levels, does that get rid of ads? 2) is it one payment for all the rest of the levels or do you pay per group?   Thanks!"

It may be very hard sometimes and you may get fustrated but it actually is very calming. I LIVE FOR THE MUSIC! The music is so relaxing and it calms you down. If you don't want noisy ads interrupting, just turn off the wifi or put your device on airplane mode, the fame with still work offline. I finished all the levels so far and is hoping more are on the way :)"

This makes the idea of using the number of moves complete nonsense when a misstep means 4 extra moves as you're forced to rotate the piece you didn't mean to touch back to its previous orientation. With that fixed it would be great. But as it is, it's frustrating not fun."

Before I realized it my young children were subjected to a half naked women dancing like a stripper. For a game that can be used by adults and children the advertising partners used by this company are reprehensible. The developer responded to my email and implied they were removing sexual ads but they lied. Nothing changed. I advise all parents of young children to boycott the creator of this game."

This is the most honest game-pay system I have ever come across- instead of forcing you to pay to win, these guys are up front- You can unlock the whole game for nothing or CHOOSE what you think it is worth. Amazing and refreshing business practice. The game is great and I feel like I am also paying for a  service from someone who cares about their product isn't treating us like faceless cash cows. Will definitely be looking out for more from the devs. Loved it, well worth every penny on more than one level."

Was enjoying the simple logic of it and finding it quite relaxing, but then many of the levels switched to timed mode rather rather than number of moves. Not fun, just added stress I don't need. Also rather exclusionary to many folks with physical disabilities."

        "comment": "  The game is really laggy, which makes it difficult to get into the puzzle-solving. Going back to the level select after every level instead of just moving on to the next is a little annoying (the ads also break immersion, but I forgive it for supporting the developers). The perspective made the touch controls imprecise, and I often had to fix a tile that I misclicked, wasting moves. The puzzles are either contrived or too straightforward. It kind of feels uninspired? I guess it lacks variety. They don't do much with the one new mechanic added in the beginning of the game. Reminds me of Infinity Loop, but with a move limit, which sucks. It's harder to play and not as good.  The aesthetic is lovely, though, and I definitely had fun with the timed levels before the game kicked me out with a paywall. Maybe if those were the main focus of the game I'd consider it."

This game looks gorgeous and the music and sound effects make it very relaxing to play. The controls are impossible not to understand, and it offers a good challenge.

Since it's often a race against time, I would usually have to redo a lvl several times. The birds eye view made it very difficult. I would suggest adding the option of top down view for ease of taping, or make an ability that pauses time when I hold the finger on a piece u wish to rotate and have it light up, so that I know I've selected then right one."

Accompanied by a beautiful soundtrack and crisp, tasteful graphics, it's an easy-to-play puzzle based on a simple concept that is executed well. My only gripe is how easy it can be to hit the wrong piece, but that may be more to do with my fat fingers and poor screen callibration than game mechanics. Would be nice if there was some more variety in difficulty across levels: introducing different shaped pieces (like the \"T\" blocks), multiple exits, specific spots you have to route through to obtain 3 stars, etc."

        "comment": "  Technically pretty well made; just one tiny 'issue' - when turning a piece multiple times, I think the player has to wait too long between subsequent presses. Game is okay to play. As someone else said, it's calming - helped by the music, and the levels are nicely 'bitesize' with a reasonable progression throughout. I think the only thing that lets it down for me is the lack of breadth in the gameplay - there's only three block types, which doesn't give much scope for variety in the levels, and once you've played a few, they start to feel a bit 'samey'. I think if you came up with a little more interest - perhaps something special for each section - it would improve the game significantly."

Sometimes it's easy to select the wrong piece so you lose 4 moves getting it back where you want it, but no biggie. Working backwards helps sometimes. Watch out for which levels count moves or water loss. Watching the flowers grow at the end if each level is satisfying. Really cute game. Option to donate for next chapter is nice, and I will certainly donate for some. Music is calming. Love it."

The first 3 sets of levels are free so you can get a feel for the game then you are presented a pay what you want for every following level pack. Ranging from 0 to 4.99. Great respect for the developers for doing that. There are also ads, but they are not videos. These ads are simple ones you can exit out of immediately. I strongly recommend this game and I also recommend you toss them a few bucks over the duration of your playthrough."

It really takes away from the experience you've tried to create. If the ads could start after the level's stars have appeared and after the music ends, it would make a big difference."

The pay what you want is a nice touch too. The controls can be a little fiddly, but shouldn't be any issue on a bigger screened device (was easy to rotate the pieces I wanted on my S7)."

The controls are hard, even with small fingers I'll often move the wrong tile when I know I'm clicking the right one. You have to pay to get pasta certain point. If you're stuck, there are no hints. The music isn't that great and the sound effects are annoying and there is no option to turn them off. Overall pretty bad game, but the graphics are good."

It is annoying you dont choose which way the ducts rotate.    Migbt I suggest using a rotationg finger to decide to rotate counter clock wise or clockwise. So youd tap a duct you wanna move and then rotate your finger in the direction you wish to rotate it."

Only played it into the second stage of the first level and a loud video started out of nowhere."

I definitely advise looking at the trending section before you go straight to finding an app because otherwise there's not going to be really much that you can find. I also recommend Sims free play although it does take up a lot of megabytes on your phone it is kind of like this but it's with Sims which people and you learn how to spend your money wisely. The two apps I have on my phone that I go on all of the time for games are colour switch and sims which are my favourite."

Last but most importantly: do not play ads without player choosing to watch ad! And come up with a reward for playing an ad video, otherwise your players will play offline like I'm doing."

Getting right into the game without a tutorial but teaching the player the mechanics of the game without words is something very hard to find that is done well. I'm very interested to see any future games or developments made by them. Keep up the WONDERFUL work."

I have to wait a bit for the game to switch the piece after tapping on it. 2) The level select process was annoying. After finishing a level, you go back to the level select instead of automatically going to the next level. The slow animations also make this annoying. 3) When you make a mistake of tapping one too many times on a piece, there is no reset button to fix this."

Then you reach level V 4 & find that it cannot be completes in less than 10 moves, but this only gives 2 stars for that & you need 3 per level to unlock the next, so you cannot progress further. Shame."

The graphics are great, the music is fantastic. The only complaint I have is the move limits. I like the challenge, but it would be nice if you could maybe toggle the move limits. Sometimes I have a piece already in place, then I go to turn the next and because the pieces are so small I hit the placed one and have to waste another 3 moves on that piece to turn it back. I also like the 'pay what you want' feature. It's nice to see that not all games are pay-to-play."

First, the aqueduct parts are so small that you will press an adjacent one on accident, requiring you to tap it three times again to get it back to where it had been. Second, there are two levels that are not possible to earn 3 stars on, namely V.4 and VII.6, where ending with 10 and 17 moves remaining is optimal yet worth 2 stars. If these problems were fixed, the game would be worth 5 stars."

I think it's also a nice feature that to unlock further levels you can choose how much you would like pay, including $0. This app would have gotten five stars from me, but the introduction of timed levels really killed my enjoyment of the game. I'd rather have a relaxing puzzle than be forced to rush. There was one level (I think 6, in the fourth section of the game) that no matter how many times I tried, how fast I turnes the pieces, I couldn't finish above 1 star. A timed level that is essentially designed for you to fall short no matter how fast you go is frustrating beyond words for me. So yea, nice while it lasted I guess."

Pair that with the unreasonably long level transitions, it really kills the gameplay. Lastly, the tap regions are sometimes a bit wonky. There's been numerous occasions where I went to tap a higher piece and it got the one 1 under, ruining the level score. I suggest a tap-to-select and rotation buttons to alleviate this."

And whenever i close it my phone notifies me that the system launcher isn't working and then i restart my phone. I don't know why is this happening but am sure that this problem is coming because of this game because before this game was downloaded my phone was running very well. Plzz fix this bug. This is the most beautiful and lite game i have ever played. I don't wanna lose it. Plz do something for me..... üò¢üò¢üò¢üò•üò•"

I would say the game perhaps lacks a tiny intro to help with transitioning. You just get thrown right into the game which can be jarring. Overall the puzzles a r e not too hard though it might take you a couple of goes on some of them. The bit I didn't like was getting halfway through the levels only to find the rest were locked and you had the pay for them. That's fine and all but I would rather see on the map that the levels are locked BEFORE I get to them. Until you reach the corresponding level you have no idea and that can be annoying when you do finally get there. I'd say overall the game is worth checking out."

I think it's that the move limits on each level don't let you experiment and try to find multiple solutions to each puzzle. It feels very streamlined and small. I'll look forward to 1.0 to see any changes."

Puzzle games like this are often cheaply made and with little aspirations outside of \"making money.\" Aquaducts avoids the Skinner Box and treats the player and its content with respect. However, it is not flawless. The controls are a bit on the janky side, but otherwise it plays exactly as one would expect. It is light on content and can be completed in a few hours  compared to the days of content its competitors sport. What it lacks in content it makes up with passion. uaJoyTech respects the material it created and its audience."

I love the option that you can pay what you want. I felt it was definitely worth something but I don't have a lot so I paid the $0.99.  But now I am upset with it because level 5-4 does not allow you to get three stars at all. I even went on YouTube and nobody has completed level 5-4 with three stars. Being a completionist game type with puzzle games this is really messing with my head.  Also, being on a small screen makes it hard to press the right duct and a restart level button would help.  Despite these, I'm still loving this immensely"

And what's with random ads popping up all over the place? the game has a relaxing tune playing and all of a sudden ad pops up sounding a lot louder than the game which wrecks the experience. Like if you do it for the money then introduce a paid environment or if not then let people enjoy it. there is truly no different minds these days, everyone is just the same (facepalm)"

I spent money to help the developer create more quality games like this one. You should too. :)   For those struggling with the timed levels, one in particular requires very fast work and for you to NOT fix the FIRST 3 way tile. Instead, set up pieces along the left side first and then fix the first tile. Moving quickly, you should be able to 3 star it like I did.   That said, I can't seem to 3 star level V-4. There seems to only be one solution, and even with the fewest moves possible, I still only get 2 stars. Can the developer or another user please confirm this?"

The controls are awful, half the time it clicks on something next to what I tapped, sometimes it doesn't even move despite me tapping directly on it. There is also no tutorial. This game doesn't really need one, but a brief explanation would help. The gameplay wasn't even worth the trouble, this game lived up to its full potential after about the first 3 levels. I would not recommend this. Although, if you are looking for a time waster, uninstalling this game is quite satisfying."

After that you have to buy the next area. The cheapest option was only $0.99 but I'm not going to play a game that forces me to pay to keep going when there are also popup ads in the game.   7 levels and 15 minutes is no where near enough time to become invested enough in a game to spend real money on it."
