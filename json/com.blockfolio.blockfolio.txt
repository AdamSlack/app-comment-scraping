But utterly incapable of handling cryptocurrency you mined yourself - you *have* to choose an exchange when entering assets, and then it figures out how much you \"paid\" for it.  Rather misleading for mined currency, albeit excellent for pure traders."

Unfortunately, it seems to have trouble connecting through the Wi-Fi when my other applications are having no problems at all.  This is very hit-and-miss and I've seen no pattern to this behaviour. I contacted the creator of the app and they responded quickly and tried to help. The bottom line is, for my needs, it's still the best app out there.  FYI, if you go to settings, then click on the bugs, then click sync, it does seem to work again for a while after that."

API for bittrex so it can automatically download all of my orders to the app. The second would be a search function for the news section so I could find info for a coin faster , maybe even a way to prepare news feed with keywords, with RSS would make this awesome... I know im asking to much but execute orders and sales would make this the ultimate application. Keep up the great work"

I have to tie a lot of pairs to the Etherdelta exchange and I get some funky numbers every once in a while and it messes with my graphs a lot. Like 1 etherdelta trade can put my portfolio up to 42b and then my graph is just one spike. Ty love the app over all."

Even if it's just some sort of FB back up, this app desperately needs some sort of back-up option. If you document all of your buys and sells and then get a new phone, you basically have to start fresh unless you want to spend hours re-inputting all of your info all over again."

Would be nice to have the full market capitalization at the top with detailed statistics. Favorite feature within the application would have to be the news. Great sources and always up to date. Keep up the great work!  Ps. where's the desktop app? And please set up a few wallets for donation. Thanks!"

I do not have any connectivity issues with other apps or wifi/cellular.  2. It shows graphs up to 1 month. If you select bigger scope, graphs are not displayed correctly.  3. It messes up graph data on 1 hour chart. Try to refresh it - on every update (if it works) graph is displayed a bit differently.  4. No graph scroll. This alone is the reason to look for another app.  Please fix all this, and I bet this will be the best exchange monitoring app out there."

Make ability to switch between normal & logerithmic scale on graphs  Some v basic technical analysis tools for graphs e.g. draw support/resistance/trend lines."

Right now I find myself switching between the holdings & chart views a lot.  And when switching the currency, the chart should switch as well (Thank you for your answer!üëç Another nice idea would be the ability to switch between coins & holdings without going back to the main screen, especially from the holdings screen, eg swipe up or down or provide 2 buttons.)"

So I would request you to please look into this option of data sync when we switch devices."

I want to request that the Blockfolio team develops a trading app.  Honestly, they are all pretty bad, and the only one with the right feel it's extremely unstable.  Blockfolio understands what people want when reading their portfolio, and I know your team could make an amazing trading app.  Thanks for making a quality product for the free market!"

I'd like it to all be one or the other (as long as I can still choose which). Would also be nice to be able to customize chart visualization further. Still a great app though. Better than pretty much every other option"
